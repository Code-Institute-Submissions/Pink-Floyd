## UX

* User Goals

    * New Users - 
        1. I want to learn about the band and discover their music. I would like to hear their music and see a video of them playing, 
        it should be easy for me to navigate the site and find out about this information.
        3. I would like to be able to buy the bands music and want to know where I can get it.
        4. I should be able to follow Pink Floyds official social media channels to keep up to date with any new releases and tour information 
       
    * Regular Users - 
        1. I want to know more about the individual band members. I would like to follow their social media channels and get to know more about them as people.
        2. I want to be able to sign up to a newsletter so that I can stay in touch with what the band is doing and get to learn about any future releases / touring information.
        3. I would also like to be able to see any official merchandise the band has and be able to purchase it. 
            
* Design

    * The site will contain classic colouring and imagery of the iconic dark side of the moon and the wall album cover's.
    * I have chosen a solid modern "Rubik" font from goole fonts that compliments the textual styling of some of Pink Floyd's albums. "The Wall" font styling would not be suitable. Sans-serif is in back up if Rubik does not work.
    * I have used imagery across the site that is well known not only to Pink Floyd fans but people beyond that. Dark side of the moon and the wall are iconic and will bring some familiarity to the site. This imagery also brings a level of trust to the user.
        * Familiar logo's, pictures of the band (old and new) and official merchandise are also displayed regularly.

* Testing User Goals

    * New Users - 
        1. You are greeted by a colourful navigation bar which is clearly labelled with additional icons for easy navigation. A story board area is the main feature 
        of the page with links to click to see, the band, the music etc. The hero banner is an immediate indication that i am in the right place.
        2. The band's music page shows 6 of their biggest albums with apple and amazon icons for people to click to purchase the music. Additional indicators are above these
        icons to bring it to their attention
        3. The bands offical social media channels are found in the footer on all pages of the website. Hover.css is used on these to let people know they can click on them. 
        Hover.css goes throug all the colours of the dark side of the moon album cover rainbow to compliment the cover and navigation bar.
        
    * Regular Users - 
        1. A band members page has been created to show members of the band as they are now. Each band member also has a famous quote of theirs attributed to them and if they 
        have any social media channels they are provided below the text. These also use hover.css in the same way.
        2. A sign-up page has been created so that people can sign up to the mailing list for all the latest news from Pink Floyd.
        3. A shop page has been created to show _some_ of the pink floyd merchandise available. Prompts are given to buy from the new web-store (another web-site) with another
        prompt at the bottom of the page to let people know there is more available from there.
        4. All cta buttons on each separate page of the side are colour coded to match the navigation bar. I.E the tours page "BUY NOW" button is colour coded #009BBE blue to 
        the colour assigned to the page from the navigation bar which came from the dark side of the moon album cover.
