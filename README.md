## UX

* User Goals

    * New Users - 
        1. I want to learn about the band and discover their music. I wwould like to hear their music and see a video of them playing
        2. It should be easy for me to navigate the site and find out about this information
        3. I would like to be able to buy the bands music and want to know where I can get it.
        4. I should be able to follow Pink Floyds official social media channels to keep up to date with any new releases and tour information 
       
    * Regular Users - 
        1. I want to know more about the individual band members. I would like to follow their social media channels and get to know more about them as people.
        2. I want to be able to sign up to a newsletter so that I can stay in touch with what the band is doing and get to learn about any future releases / touring information.
        3. I would also like to be able to see any official merchandise the band has and be able to purchase it. 
            
* Design

    * The site will contain classic colouring and imagery of the iconic dark side of the moon and the wall album cover's.
    * I have chosen a solid modern "Rubik" font from goole fonts that compliments the textual styling of some of Pink Floyd's albums. "The Wall" font styling would not be suitable. Sans-serif is in back up if Rubik does not work.
    * I have used imagery across the site that is well known not only to Pink Floyd fans but people beyond that. Dark side of the moon and the wall are iconic and will bring some familiarity to the site. This imagery also brings a level of trust to the user.
        * Familiar logo's, pictures of the band (old and new) and official merchandise are also displayed regularly.
